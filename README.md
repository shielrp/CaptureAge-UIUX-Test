# Ryan Shiel - UI/UX Engineering Test Submission

This is a small project built in the Unity Engine, version 2022.3.40f1 LTS (the latest LTS version of the engine at time of writing). It can be viewed in-engine by downloading that engine version, or a later one, and opening this project therein.

There is also a portable, standalone build for Windows provided [here](https://github.com/shielrp/CaptureAge-UIUX-Test/releases/tag/v1.0). To run this built project, download the .zip file "Ryan.Shiel.-.UI.UX.Engineer.Test.Build.zip" from this release, and extract that archive into an empty folder. Afterwards you can start the application by running "CaptureAge UI Engineer Test.exe".

This project utilizes the [DOTween](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/animation/dotween-hotween-v2-27676) tweening engine and the [Classic RPG GUI](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/classic-rpg-gui-160253) visual asset pack, both licensed from the Unity Asset Store.
